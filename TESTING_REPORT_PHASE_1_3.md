## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

### üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Coupons & Sales New Pages NOT Migrated

**MAJOR FINDING:** During testing, discovered that **2 form pages were NEVER migrated from Material-UI**. They are still 100% MUI-based with 1000+ lines each.

#### 1. Coupons New Page - COMPLETELY MUI (NOT MIGRATED)

**File:** `src/app/seller/coupons/new/page.tsx`  
**Status:** ‚ùå **NEVER MIGRATED** - 100% Material-UI code  
**Size:** 1,091 lines  
**Error Count:** 38 TypeScript errors  
**MUI Components Used:** Box, Container, Typography, Card, TextField, Button, **Grid**, FormControl, Select, Switch, Tabs, Autocomplete, Checkbox, Snackbar, etc.

**Lines with Grid errors:** 339, 348, 373, 388, 402, 416, 437, 465, 487, 509, 516, 527, 541, 562, 568, 581, 604, 611, 617, 637, 657, 664, 684, 711, 761, 768, 784, 800, 852, 859, 900, 949, 956, 977, 991

#### 2. Sales New Page - COMPLETELY MUI (NOT MIGRATED)

**File:** `src/app/seller/sales/new/page.tsx`  
**Status:** ‚ùå **NEVER MIGRATED** - 100% Material-UI code  
**Size:** ~500-600 lines (estimate)  
**Expected Errors:** Similar to Coupons New

**Impact:**

- ‚ùå BOTH pages still use full MUI library
- ‚ùå NOT using unified design system
- ‚ùå TypeScript compilation errors
- ‚ùå Inconsistent with other migrated pages
- ‚ùå Will break if MUI is removed from dependencies

**Root Cause:** These pages were likely marked as "complete" in the checklist but the actual migration was never performed. Only the simpler pages (Products, Edit) were migrated.

### Previous Assessment

~~### 1. Coupons New Page - MUI Grid Components Remaining~~

This was initially thought to be a partial migration with only Grid components remaining. **Actually, the ENTIRE page is still MUI-based and was never migrated at all.**

### Tasks Completed

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Add RoleGuard Protection

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Taken:** 15 minutes  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Files Fixed:**

1. ✅ `src/app/admin/arenas/page.tsx`
   - Added RoleGuard wrapper
   - Added breadcrumb tracking
   - Improved UI consistency
   - Added helpful links to alternative pages
2. ✅ `src/app/admin/game/settings/page.tsx`
   - Added RoleGuard wrapper
   - Added breadcrumb tracking
   - Improved UI consistency
   - Added links to existing game settings

**Changes Made:**

```tsx
// Before (INSECURE)
export default function ArenasPage() {
  return <div>Content</div>;
}

// After (SECURE)
import RoleGuard from "@/components/features/auth/RoleGuard";

export default function ArenasPage() {
  return (
    <RoleGuard requiredRole="admin">
      <ArenasPageContent />
    </RoleGuard>
  );
}
```

**Verification:**

- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Pages require admin authentication
- [x] Breadcrumbs display correctly
- [x] UI matches other admin pages

---

#### ✅ Task 1.2: Verify TypeScript Params Handling

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Already Fixed)  
**Time Taken:** 5 minutes  
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**Files Checked:**

1. ✅ `src/app/admin/game/beyblades/edit/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Already using `use(params)` pattern (Next.js 15+)
   - No TypeScript errors
2. ✅ `src/app/admin/game/stadiums/edit/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Already using `use(params)` pattern (Next.js 15+)
   - No TypeScript errors

**Pattern Used (Correct):**

```tsx
import { use } from "react";

export default function EditPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = use(params); // Unwrap the Promise
  // ... rest of code
}
```

**Note:** All dynamic route pages are already using the correct Next.js 15+ async params pattern. No fixes needed.

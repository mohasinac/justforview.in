## üîµ Blue Loop Charge Point Selection

### How It Works

When your Beyblade enters the blue loop (inner circle), you have **1 second** to select your preferred charge point:

- **Press `1`** (or `Right Click`): Select Point 1 at 30¬∞ angle
- **Press `2`** (or `Left Click`): Select Point 2 at 150¬∞ angle
- **Press `3`** (or `Middle Click`): Select Point 3 at 270¬∞ angle
- **No selection**: Random charge point is chosen automatically

### Charge Points Explained

```
        Point 2 (150¬∞)
              |
              |
Point 3 ------+------ Point 1 (30¬∞)
   (270¬∞)     |
              |
           Center
```

### Strategy Tips

- **Point 1 (30¬∞)**: Right side exit - good for aggressive right positioning
- **Point 2 (150¬∞)**: Top-left exit - strategic for corner control
- **Point 3 (270¬∞)**: Bottom exit - excellent for center control

## ‚ö° Combat Mechanics

### Damage Calculation

Base damage is now affected by special attack multipliers:

```typescript
// Base damage (60% of original for easier gameplay)
baseDamage = (avgAccel + opponentAccel) * 0.6

// With Heavy Attack
damage = baseDamage * 1.25

// With Ultimate Attack
damage = baseDamage * 2.0

// Ultimate + Charge Dash combo
damage = baseDamage * 2.0 (from ultimate) + enhanced knockback
```

### Attack Duration

- **Heavy Attack**: Active for 0.3 seconds
- **Ultimate Attack**: Active for 0.5 seconds
- Attacks auto-expire after duration
- Can't stack multiple attacks simultaneously

## üéØ Advanced Tactics

### 1. **Dodge Canceling**

- Use dodge to escape blue loop early
- Quick repositioning during charge dash
- Evade predictable AI patterns

### 2. **Attack Timing**

- Activate Heavy Attack just before collision
- Ultimate Attack during charge dash for maximum impact
- Combine with blue loop exit for devastating combos

### 3. **Spin Management**

- Dodges cost 20 spin each - use wisely
- Ultimate costs 100 spin - save for key moments
- Heavy Attack is free - spam-friendly but short duration

### 4. **Charge Point Strategy**

- Predict opponent position
- Select point that exits toward center for follow-up attacks
- Random selection can surprise experienced opponents

## üîß Balance Changes

### Blue Loop Acceleration

- **Previous**: 4√ó acceleration multiplier during loop
- **Current**: 1.3√ó acceleration multiplier
- **Reason**: Better control, less chaotic exits

### Charge Dash

- Still provides 1.25√ó knockback multiplier
- 3-second duration for strategic play
- Enhanced acceleration cap of 25 (up from 15)

### Cooldowns

- Dodge cooldown: 0.5 seconds (prevents spam)
- No cooldown on attacks (balanced by duration)

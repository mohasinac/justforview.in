---

## Technical Excellence

### Architecture Patterns

**1. Reusable Component Pattern**

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  context: "admin" | "seller"; // Context-aware behavior
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  breadcrumbs?: Breadcrumb[];
  // Feature-specific props...
}
```

**2. Context-Aware API Calls**

```typescript
const fetchData = async () => {
  if (context === "admin") {
    response = await apiClient.get(`/api/admin/${feature}`);
  } else {
    response = await apiGet(`/api/seller/${feature}`);
  }
};
```

**3. Conditional Rendering**

```typescript
const columns = [
  // Common columns...
  ...(context === "admin" ? [
    { key: "seller", label: "Seller", render: ... }
  ] : []),
];
```

### Architecture Patterns

**1. Reusable Component Pattern (10/10 features)**

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  breadcrumbs?: Breadcrumb[];
  // Feature-specific props...
}
```

**2. Context-Aware Behavior (where applicable)**

```typescript
const fetchData = async () => {
  if (context === "admin") {
    response = await apiClient.get(`/api/admin/${feature}`);
  } else {
    response = await apiGet(`/api/seller/${feature}`);
  }
};
```

**3. Admin-Only Pattern (Users, Categories)**

```typescript
// Single context, simplified props
interface UsersProps {
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  breadcrumbs?: Breadcrumb[];
}
```

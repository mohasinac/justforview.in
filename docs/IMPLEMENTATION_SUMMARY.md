## 🎨 Key Design Patterns

### 1. Context Pattern

Used for global state management (cart, wishlist, currency)

### 2. Component Composition

Small, reusable components that compose into larger features

### 3. API Route Handlers

Server-side logic separated from client components

### 4. Protected Routes

Authentication checks at page level

### 5. Progressive Enhancement

Core functionality works, then add polish

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### After Each Phase:

1. ✅ Manual testing in browser
2. ✅ Check console for errors
3. ✅ Test on mobile view
4. ✅ Test edge cases
5. ✅ Verify persistence

### End-to-End Test:

1. Browse products
2. Add to cart
3. Update quantities
4. Proceed to checkout
5. Add address
6. Complete payment
7. View order
8. Verify all data

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Not wrapping with providers**

   - Ensure all contexts wrap the app in layout.tsx

2. **Forgetting to save to localStorage**

   - Always sync state with localStorage

3. **Not handling loading states**

   - Show loaders for async operations

4. **Missing error handling**

   - Wrap API calls in try-catch

5. **Skipping mobile testing**

   - Test on mobile view throughout

6. **Not testing edge cases**

   - Empty cart, out of stock, etc.

7. **Hardcoding values**

   - Use environment variables

8. **Not validating input**
   - Validate on both client and server

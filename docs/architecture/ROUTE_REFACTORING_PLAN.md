# UI Routes Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for JustForView.in UI routes to improve organization, maintainability, and user experience.

## Current Issues

1. Flat route structure without logical grouping
2. Mixed concerns (user, admin, seller routes)
3. Inconsistent naming conventions
4. Testing routes mixed with production routes
5. Route duplication and unclear hierarchy

## Proposed New Structure

### 1. Public Routes (Root Level)

/help                       # Help center
/faq                        # FAQ
/privacy                    # Privacy policy

# Game Improvements - Dodge Immunity & UI Enhancements

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

This document details three major improvements to the beyblade battle game:

1. Dodge immunity for dash line crossing
2. Directional stats bars (P1 left-to-right, P2 right-to-left)
3. Centralized constants management

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Dodge Immunity System ✅

**Problem**: When players used the dodge ability, they could accidentally trigger the blue circle dash mechanic while trying to evade attacks, leading to loss of control.

**Solution**: Implemented a dodge immunity system that prevents dash line triggers during dodge animations.

#### Technical Implementation:

**New Property** (`game.ts`):

```typescript
isDodging: boolean; // Track if currently in dodge animation (immune to dash triggers)
```

**Dodge State Management** (`useGameState.ts`):

- Set `isDodging = true` when dodge is activated
- Track `lastDodgeTime` for duration management
- Clear `isDodging` after 500ms animation completes
- Added immunity check to blue loop trigger condition

**Blue Loop Detection** (`useGameState.ts`):

```typescript
// Old: if (isOnBlueCircle && ... && !beyblade.isChargeDashing)
// New: if (isOnBlueCircle && ... && !beyblade.isChargeDashing && !beyblade.isDodging)
```

#### Benefits:

- ✅ Players can dodge freely without worrying about dash triggers
- ✅ Better control during intense combat
- ✅ More strategic dodge usage
- ✅ Prevents accidental automation during evasive maneuvers

### 2. Directional Stats Bars ✅

**Problem**: Both P1 and P2 stats bars filled from left to right, making it harder to track P2's status at a glance.

**Solution**: Made P2 (AI) stats bars fill from right to left for better visual balance and easier comparison.

#### Technical Implementation:

**Stats Bar Rendering** (`GameArena.tsx` - `drawCornerStats` function):

**Spin Bar**:

```typescript
// Player: Left to right
ctx.fillRect(x + 5, spinBarY, spinFillWidth, 8);

// AI: Right to left
ctx.fillRect(x + width - 5 - spinFillWidth, spinBarY, spinFillWidth, 8);
```

**Acceleration Bar**:

```typescript
// Player: Left to right
ctx.fillRect(x + 5, accelBarY, accelFillWidth, 8);

// AI: Right to left
ctx.fillRect(x + width - 5 - accelFillWidth, accelBarY, accelFillWidth, 8);
```

#### Visual Improvements:

- ✅ P1 (left corner): Bars fill left → right
- ✅ P2 (right corner): Bars fill right → left
- ✅ Symmetrical visual design
- ✅ Easier to compare both players' stats
- ✅ More intuitive UI layout

---

### 3. Centralized Constants Management ✅

**Problem**: Magic numbers and configuration values were scattered across multiple files, making it hard to tune gameplay balance and maintain consistency.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive `constants.ts` file that centralizes all game configuration values.

#### New File Structure:

**Location**: `src/app/game/constants.ts`

**Categories**:

1. **STADIUM** - All arena dimensions and radii
2. **BEYBLADE** - Physics, stats, and movement
3. **PLAYER_MOVEMENT** - Player-specific controls
4. **AI_MOVEMENT** - AI behavior parameters
5. **DODGE** - Dodge mechanics
6. **HEAVY_ATTACK** - Normal attack settings
7. **ULTIMATE_ATTACK** - Power attack settings
8. **BLUE_LOOP** - Charge dash and normal loop mechanics
9. **COLLISION** - Damage and physics calculations
10. **WALL** - Wall collision behavior
11. **SPIN_DECAY** - Spin loss rates
12. **CHARGE_DASH_BOUNDS** - Stadium boundary behavior
13. **RENDERING** - Visual settings and colors
14. **COUNTDOWN** - Match start countdown
15. **TIMING** - Frame rate and performance
16. **CONTROLS** - Input mappings

#### Example Constants:

```typescript
export const STADIUM = {
  WIDTH: 800,
  HEIGHT: 800,
  NORMAL_LOOP_RADIUS: 200,
  CHARGE_DASH_RADIUS: 300,
  INNER_RADIUS: 360,
  OUTER_RADIUS: 380,
  CHARGE_POINT_ANGLES: [30, 150, 270] as const,
} as const;

export const DODGE = {
  SPEED: 400,
  SPIN_COST: 20,
  COOLDOWN: 0.5,
  ANIMATION_DURATION: 500,
  IMMUNITY_RADIUS_TOLERANCE: 5,
} as const;
```

#### Benefits:

- ✅ Single source of truth for all values
- ✅ Easy gameplay balancing
- ✅ Better code maintainability
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript const assertions
- ✅ Clear documentation for each value
- ✅ Prevents magic numbers in codebase

## Modified Files

### Core Game Files:

1. **`src/app/game/constants.ts`** - NEW! Centralized constants
2. **`src/app/game/types/game.ts`** - Added `isDodging` property
3. **`src/app/game/utils/beybladeUtils.ts`** - Initialize `isDodging: false`
4. **`src/app/game/hooks/useGameState.ts`** - Dodge immunity logic
5. **`src/app/game/components/GameArena.tsx`** - Directional stats bars

### Changes Summary:

| File             | Lines Changed | Purpose                        |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| constants.ts     | +276 (new)    | Centralized game configuration |
| game.ts          | +1            | Added isDodging property       |
| beybladeUtils.ts | +1            | Initialize isDodging flag      |
| useGameState.ts  | +7            | Dodge immunity implementation  |
| GameArena.tsx    | +12           | Directional stats bars         |

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Dodge immunity works (no dash trigger during dodge)
- ✅ Dodge animation still shows correctly
- ✅ Dodge cooldown still functions
- ✅ P1 stats bars fill left to right
- ✅ P2 stats bars fill right to left
- ✅ Stats bars maintain correct colors
- ✅ Constants file has no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All game mechanics still work correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Constants Integration:

The `constants.ts` file is ready for use throughout the codebase. Future tasks include:

1. **Replace magic numbers** in existing files with constant references
2. **Add comments** linking to constants for better code documentation
3. **Create gameplay presets** (Easy, Normal, Hard) using constant variations
4. **Add configuration UI** to let players adjust some constants in-game

### Additional Improvements:

1. Add visual feedback when dodge immunity is active (e.g., shield icon)
2. Consider adding similar immunity for other special moves
3. Expand stats bars to show cooldown timers visually
4. Add color gradients to stats bars for better visual appeal

---

## Developer Notes

### Using Constants:

```typescript
import { DODGE, STADIUM, BEYBLADE } from "../constants";

// Example usage:
if (playerBey.spin >= DODGE.SPIN_COST) {
  playerBey.spin -= DODGE.SPIN_COST;
  playerBey.velocity.x += DODGE.SPEED;
  playerBey.dodgeCooldownEnd = gameTime + DODGE.COOLDOWN;
}
```

### Dodge Immunity Flow:

1. Player presses dodge button (1 or 2)
2. `isDodging = true`, `lastDodgeTime = Date.now()`
3. Blue loop detection skips dodging beyblades
4. After 500ms, `isDodging = false`
5. Normal dash triggers resume

### Stats Bar Direction Logic:

```typescript
// Player (isPlayer = true): x + 5 (left to right)
// AI (isPlayer = false): x + width - 5 - fillWidth (right to left)
```

## Performance Impact

- **Dodge Immunity**: Negligible (single boolean check per frame)
- **Directional Bars**: Negligible (simple x-coordinate calculation)
- **Constants File**: None (compile-time only)

**Overall**: No performance degradation. Code is more maintainable and efficient.

---

## Conclusion

These three improvements significantly enhance the game's playability and maintainability:

1. **Dodge immunity** gives players better control and reduces frustration
2. **Directional stats bars** improve UI clarity and visual balance
3. **Centralized constants** make the codebase more maintainable and easier to tune

All changes are backward-compatible and maintain existing functionality while adding new features.

# Power System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a new power system to replace acceleration display in HUD, with power gain mechanics and restricted movement control during loops/charge dash.

## Key Changes

### 1. Power System Basics
- **Range**: 0-25 (not 0-100)
- **Display**: Replaces "Acceleration" in all HUD components
- **Purpose**: Resource management for special moves

### 2. Power Gain Mechanics
- **Normal gameplay**: +5 power/second
- **During loops or charge dash**: +10 power/second (2x rate)
- **Maximum cap**: 25 (full bar)
- **Implementation**: Added to `updateBeybladeLogic()` function

### 3. Movement Control Restrictions
**Players lose movement control during:**
- Normal Loop (200 radius circle)
- Blue Loop/Charge Dash (300 radius circle)
- Charge Dash state

**Players CAN still use special moves to escape danger:**
- Dodge Left/Right (costs 10 power)
- Heavy Attack (costs 15 power)
- Ultimate Attack (costs 25 power - full bar)

This creates strategic tension: players must decide when to use precious power to escape dangerous loop situations.

### 4. Special Move Power Costs

#### Dodge (Left/Right)
- **Cost**: 10 power
- **Previous cost**: 20 spin
- **Effect**: Quick 50-unit dash left or right
- **Cooldown**: 2 seconds

#### Heavy Attack
- **Cost**: 15 power
- **Previous cost**: None (cooldown only)
- **Effect**: 100-unit attack dash in direction of joystick/mouse
- **Cooldown**: 5 seconds

#### Ultimate Attack
- **Cost**: 25 power (full bar)
- **Previous cost**: 100 spin
- **Effect**: 150-unit powerful dash in direction of joystick/mouse
- **Cooldown**: 5 seconds

### 5. Files Modified

#### Type Definitions
- `src/app/game/types/game.ts`
  - Added `power: number // 0-25` to BeybladePhysics interface
  - Marked acceleration as deprecated

#### HUD Components (All Updated)
1. **GameArena.tsx** - Canvas-based HUD
   - Replaced acceleration bar with power bar
   - Display: "Power: X/25"
   
2. **GameArenaPixi.tsx** - PixiJS-based HUD
   - Replaced acceleration bar with power bar
   - Updated graphics and text rendering
   
3. **EnhancedBeybladeArena.tsx** - Main arena wrapper
   - Changed stats display from "Acceleration: X/10" to "Power: X/25"
   
4. **MatchResultScreen.tsx** - End game results
   - Changed from "Final Acceleration: X" to "Final Power: X/25"

#### Game Logic
- `src/app/game/hooks/useGameState.ts`
  - **Initialization**: Set `power = 0` for both player and AI beyblades
  - **Power Gain**: Added logic in `updateBeybladeLogic()`
  - **Movement Control**: Restricted during `isInNormalLoop || isInBlueLoop || isChargeDashing`
  - **Special Moves**: Updated all player special moves to consume power
  - **AI Special Moves**: Updated AI dodge/heavy/ultimate to use power system
  - **Multiplayer Sync**: Added power to `getMyBeybladeState()` and `setOpponentBeybladeState()`

### 6. Damage System (Previous Update)
- **Base damage multiplier**: Reduced from 0.15 to 0.08 (~47% reduction)
- **Energy transfer factor**: Reduced from 0.001 to 0.0005 (50% reduction)
- **Max damage cap**: Reduced from 200 to 120 (40% reduction)
- **Result**: Longer, more strategic battles

## Strategic Gameplay Impact

### Risk/Reward During Loops
1. **Loop Entry**: Players lose movement control but gain power 2x faster (10/sec vs 5/sec)
2. **Danger Escape**: Can use special moves (at power cost) to escape collisions
3. **Resource Management**: Must decide whether to save power or use it defensively

### Power Management Strategy
- **Early Game**: Build up power (0→25 in 5 seconds normal, 2.5 seconds in loops)
- **Mid Game**: Use dodge (10) and heavy (15) strategically
- **Ultimate Move**: Requires full bar (25), devastating but leaves you powerless
- **Loop Strategy**: Enter loops for faster power gain, use special moves if threatened

### Combat Flow
1. Build power through normal movement (+5/sec)
2. Enter loops for faster power gain (+10/sec) but risk losing control
3. Use special moves strategically to:
   - Escape dangerous situations (dodge: 10 power)
   - Attack opportunistically (heavy: 15 power)
   - Finish opponents (ultimate: 25 power)
4. Balance offense and defense with limited power resource

## Multiplayer Compatibility
- Power values are synced between clients
- Server-side collision damage calculation remains unchanged
- Both players follow same power gain/consumption rules
- Fair and synchronized gameplay

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Power initializes to 0 at game start
- [x] Power gains at 5/sec during normal movement
- [x] Power gains at 10/sec during loops/charge dash
- [x] Power caps at 25 maximum
- [x] Movement control restricted during loops/charge dash
- [x] Special moves work during loops (escape mechanism)
- [x] Dodge consumes 10 power
- [x] Heavy attack consumes 15 power
- [x] Ultimate attack consumes 25 power
- [x] HUD displays "Power: X/25" correctly
- [x] Multiplayer sync includes power values
- [x] AI uses power system for special moves
- [x] **AI STATE VERIFIED** - AI gains/consumes power correctly
- [x] **SERVER STATE VERIFIED** - Multiplayer sync working properly
- [x] **NO COMPILE ERRORS** - All files compile successfully

## Verification Status: ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

### AI State Management ✅
- AI power gain: Working (5/sec normal, 10/sec in loops)
- AI power consumption: Working (10/15/25 for dodge/heavy/ultimate)
- AI initialization: Working (starts at 0 power)
- AI HUD display: Working (shows "Power: X/25")

### Server State Management ✅
- Power transmission: Working (client → server → opponent)
- Power reception: Working (opponent → client)
- State storage: Working (server stores full beyblade state)
- Collision system: Compatible (independent of power system)

### Movement Control ✅
- Loop restriction: Working (no movement during loops)
- Special moves: Working (can escape dangerous situations)
- Power gain bonus: Working (2x rate in loops)

See [POWER_SYSTEM_VERIFICATION.md](./POWER_SYSTEM_VERIFICATION.md) for detailed verification report.

## Future Enhancements
- Add visual feedback when power is insufficient for special moves
- Add sound effects for power gain milestones (10, 15, 25)
- Consider power regeneration pause during special moves
- Add power surge mechanic when winning/losing streak

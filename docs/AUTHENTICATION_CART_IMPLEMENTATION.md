# Authentication & Cart Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Authentication System with Proper Redirects**

- **AuthContext**: Created centralized authentication state management
- **Login Redirect**: Users are redirected to the last page they were trying to access after login
- **Session Storage**: Used localStorage to store intended redirect path
- **Middleware**: Server-side route protection with automatic redirects
- **Protected Routes**: Account, admin, seller pages require authentication

### 2. **Cart Persistence System**

- **CartContext**: Global cart state management for both guests and authenticated users
- **Guest Cart**: Stored in localStorage until user logs in
- **Cart Sync**: Guest cart automatically syncs to user cart upon login
- **Dynamic Cart Count**: Header shows real-time cart item count
- **Persistent Storage**: Cart survives page refreshes and browser sessions

### 3. **User Interface Improvements**

- **Dynamic Header**: Shows user menu with name/avatar when logged in, Sign In button when not
- **User Dropdown**: Contains links to Account, Orders, Dashboard (role-based), and Sign Out
- **Cart Integration**: Add to Cart buttons on product cards work with cart context
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for authentication and cart operations

### 4. **Authentication Flow**

- **Login Page**: Uses AuthContext, redirects to intended page after successful login
- **Register Page**: Also redirects to intended page after registration
- **Logout**: Clears all authentication data and cart, redirects to home
- **Auto-Login Check**: Checks authentication status on app load

### 5. **Route Protection**

- **Middleware**: Server-side protection for `/account`, `/admin`, `/seller`, `/checkout`
- **ProtectedRoute Component**: Client-side route protection with loading states
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and seller routes check user roles
- **Unauthorized Page**: Proper error page for insufficient permissions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Files Created/Modified:

1. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Authentication state management
2. **`src/contexts/CartContext.tsx`** - Cart state management
3. **`src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`** - Route protection component
4. **`src/hooks/useAuthRedirect.ts`** - Authentication utilities
5. **`src/middleware.ts`** - Server-side route protection
6. **`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`** - Updated with auth state
7. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** - Added context providers
8. **`src/app/cart/page.tsx`** - Updated cart page
9. **`src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx`** - Added cart functionality

### Features in Action:

#### 🔐 **Login Redirect Flow**:

1. User tries to access `/account` (protected route)
2. Middleware redirects to `/login` and stores `/account` in cookies
3. User logs in successfully
4. AuthContext redirects user back to `/account`
5. User can access their account page

#### 🛒 **Cart Persistence Flow**:

1. Guest user adds items to cart → Stored in localStorage
2. User logs in → Guest cart syncs to user cart via API
3. localStorage cart is cleared
4. Cart persists across sessions for authenticated users

#### 🚦 **Authentication State**:

- **Not logged in**: Shows "Sign In" button
- **Logged in**: Shows user avatar, name, and dropdown menu
- **Loading**: Shows spinner while checking auth status

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

- ❌ Login redirected to home page regardless of where user came from
- ❌ Cart didn't persist between sessions
- ❌ Sign In button showed even after login
- ❌ No proper user menu or account access

### After:

- ✅ Login redirects to the page user was trying to access
- ✅ Cart persists in localStorage for guests, syncs on login
- ✅ Dynamic header shows authentication state properly
- ✅ User menu with relevant links (Account, Orders, Dashboard)
- ✅ Cart count shows in header badge
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Server-side route protection via middleware
- Role-based access control
- Automatic token validation
- Secure logout that clears all client data

## 📱 **Mobile Responsive**

- Mobile menu includes authentication state
- User menu works on mobile devices
- Cart and authentication work seamlessly across screen sizes

## 🚀 **Next Steps** (Future Enhancements)

1. Add "Remember Me" functionality for longer sessions
2. Implement password reset flow
3. Add social login (Google, Facebook)
4. Email verification for new accounts
5. Shopping cart API endpoints for server-side cart management
6. Wishlist functionality
7. Order history integration

The authentication and cart systems are now fully functional with proper session management, redirect handling, and user experience improvements!

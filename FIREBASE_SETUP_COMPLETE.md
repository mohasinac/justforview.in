## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Role-based access control** (admin, customer)
- **User isolation** - users can only access their own data
- **Admin privileges** for managing products, orders, and users

### Data Validation

- **Review validation** - rating between 1-5, comment length limits
- **Order validation** - required fields, status validation
- **Auction validation** - bid amounts, auction timing
- **Contact form validation** - email format, field length limits

### File Upload Security

- **File type restrictions** - only allowed formats
- **File size limits** - prevent abuse
- **Path-based access control** - users can only access their own files
- **Temporary upload cleanup** - prevents storage bloat

### Performance Optimizations

- **Composite indexes** for efficient queries
- **Query pagination** support
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live data updates

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Environment Setup

If you haven't already, you need to:

1. Get Firebase Admin SDK credentials from Firebase Console
2. Update `.env.local` with your service account details:
   ```env
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=justforview1
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@justforview1.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour_Private_Key_Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   ```

### 2. Initialize Sample Data

Run the initialization script once you have Admin SDK credentials:

```powershell
npm run firebase:init-data
```

### 3. Create Admin User

Create an admin user for testing:

```powershell
npm run firebase:create-admin
```

### 4. Start Development

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 5. Monitor & Maintain

- Check Firebase Console for usage and performance
- Monitor security rule performance
- Review storage usage and costs
- Set up backup strategies for production

## Firebase Console URLs

- **Project Overview**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/justforview1/overview
- **Firestore Database**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/justforview1/firestore
- **Storage**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/justforview1/storage
- **Authentication**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/justforview1/authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied Errors**: Check if rules are deployed and user is authenticated
2. **File Upload Failures**: Verify file size and format restrictions
3. **Query Performance**: Review indexes and optimize queries
4. **Admin SDK Issues**: Ensure environment variables are properly formatted

### Getting Help

- Check Firebase Console logs for detailed error messages
- Review browser developer console for client-side issues
- Monitor server logs for Admin SDK errors

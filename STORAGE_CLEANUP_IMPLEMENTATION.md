# Firebase Storage Cleanup & Rename Implementation

## üéØ Objective

Automatically clean up Firebase Storage when products are deleted and rename storage folders when product slugs are updated.

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Storage Deletion on Product Delete**

When a product is deleted, all associated media files are automatically removed from Firebase Storage.

**Triggers:**

- Product deletion via DELETE `/api/seller/products/[id]`

**What Gets Deleted:**

- All images in `sellers/{sellerId}/products/{slug}/`
- All videos in `sellers/{sellerId}/products/{slug}/`
- All thumbnails in `sellers/{sellerId}/products/{slug}/`
- The entire folder structure

### 2. **Automatic Storage Rename on Slug Update**

When a product's slug is changed, the storage folder is renamed and all media URLs are updated.

**Triggers:**

- Slug change via PUT `/api/seller/products/[id]` with `seo.slug` field

**What Happens:**

1. Validates new slug uniqueness
2. Renames storage folder: `buy-old-slug` ‚Üí `buy-new-slug`
3. Copies all files to new folder
4. Deletes old files
5. Updates all media URLs in product document

---

## üîß Implementation Details

### File Modified

**`src/app/api/seller/products/[id]/route.ts`**

### New Helper Functions

#### 1. `deleteStorageFolder()`

Deletes all files in a product's storage folder.

```typescript
async function deleteStorageFolder(sellerId: string, slug: string) {
  const storage = getAdminStorage();
  const bucket = storage.bucket();
  const folderPath = `sellers/${sellerId}/products/${slug}/`;

  // List all files in the folder
  const [files] = await bucket.getFiles({ prefix: folderPath });

  // Delete all files
  await Promise.all(files.map((file) => file.delete()));

  console.log(`Deleted ${files.length} files from ${folderPath}`);
}
```

**Usage:**

- Called in DELETE route before deleting product document
- Gracefully handles errors (logs but doesn't fail deletion)

#### 2. `renameStorageFolder()`

Renames a storage folder by copying and deleting files.

```typescript
async function renameStorageFolder(
  sellerId: string,
  oldSlug: string,
  newSlug: string
) {
  const storage = getAdminStorage();
  const bucket = storage.bucket();
  const oldFolderPath = `sellers/${sellerId}/products/${oldSlug}/`;
  const newFolderPath = `sellers/${sellerId}/products/${newSlug}/`;

  // List all files in the old folder
  const [files] = await bucket.getFiles({ prefix: oldFolderPath });

  // Copy each file to new location and delete old file
  await Promise.all(
    files.map(async (file) => {
      const oldPath = file.name;
      const fileName = oldPath.replace(oldFolderPath, "");
      const newPath = `${newFolderPath}${fileName}`;

      // Copy to new location
      await file.copy(newPath);
      // Delete old file
      await file.delete();
    })
  );

  console.log(`Renamed folder with ${files.length} files`);
}
```

**Usage:**

- Called in PUT route when slug changes
- Gracefully handles errors (logs but doesn't fail update)

#### 3. `updateMediaURLs()`

Updates media URLs in product document when slug changes.

```typescript
function updateMediaURLs(media: any, oldSlug: string, newSlug: string): any {
  const updatedMedia = { ...media };

  // Update image URLs
  if (updatedMedia.images && Array.isArray(updatedMedia.images)) {
    updatedMedia.images = updatedMedia.images.map((img: any) => ({
      ...img,
      url: img.url?.replace(`/products/${oldSlug}/`, `/products/${newSlug}/`),
      path: img.path?.replace(`/products/${oldSlug}/`, `/products/${newSlug}/`),
    }));
  }

  // Update video URLs
  if (updatedMedia.videos && Array.isArray(updatedMedia.videos)) {
    updatedMedia.videos = updatedMedia.videos.map((video: any) => ({
      ...video,
      url: video.url?.replace(`/products/${oldSlug}/`, `/products/${newSlug}/`),
      thumbnail: video.thumbnail?.replace(
        `/products/${oldSlug}/`,
        `/products/${newSlug}/`
      ),
      path: video.path?.replace(
        `/products/${oldSlug}/`,
        `/products/${newSlug}/`
      ),
    }));
  }

  return updatedMedia;
}
```

**Usage:**

- Called in PUT route after renaming storage folder
- Updates all image and video URLs to point to new location

## üìä API Route Changes

### DELETE `/api/seller/products/[id]`

**Before:**

```typescript
// Delete the product
await docRef.delete();

// TODO: Also delete associated media from Firebase Storage
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Delete associated media from Firebase Storage
const slug = productData?.seo?.slug;
if (slug) {
  await deleteStorageFolder(uid, slug);
}

// Delete the product document
await docRef.delete();
```

**Flow:**

1. Verify authentication
2. Get product data
3. Verify ownership
4. **Delete storage folder** ‚ú® NEW
5. Delete Firestore document
6. Return success

---

### PUT `/api/seller/products/[id]`

**Before:**

```typescript
// Validate slug uniqueness if changed
if (body.seo?.slug && body.seo.slug !== existingProduct?.seo?.slug) {
  // Check if slug exists
  // ...
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Validate slug uniqueness if changed
if (body.seo?.slug && body.seo.slug !== existingProduct?.seo?.slug) {
  // Check if slug exists
  // ...

  // Rename storage folder if slug changed ‚ú® NEW
  const oldSlug = existingProduct?.seo?.slug;
  const newSlug = body.seo.slug;
  if (oldSlug && newSlug && oldSlug !== newSlug) {
    await renameStorageFolder(uid, oldSlug, newSlug);

    // Update media URLs in the update data ‚ú® NEW
    if (body.media || existingProduct?.media) {
      const mediaToUpdate = body.media || existingProduct?.media;
      body.media = updateMediaURLs(mediaToUpdate, oldSlug, newSlug);
    }
  }
}
```

**Flow:**

1. Verify authentication
2. Get existing product
3. Verify ownership
4. Validate SKU uniqueness (if changed)
5. Validate slug uniqueness (if changed)
6. **If slug changed:**
   - Rename storage folder ‚ú® NEW
   - Update media URLs ‚ú® NEW
7. Prepare update data
8. Update Firestore document
9. Return updated product

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

Both storage operations are wrapped in try-catch and log errors without failing the main operation:

```typescript
try {
  await deleteStorageFolder(uid, slug);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error deleting storage folder:`, error);
  // Continue with product deletion
}
```

**Why?**

- Storage cleanup is a bonus feature
- Product deletion/update should succeed even if storage operations fail
- Prevents orphaned Firestore documents

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **No slug in product** - Skip storage operations
2. **No files in folder** - Log and continue
3. **Network errors** - Log and continue
4. **Permission errors** - Log and continue
5. **Storage bucket not configured** - Log and continue

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Automatic Cleanup** - No manual storage management needed
2. **Cost Savings** - Removes unused files, reduces storage costs
3. **Data Integrity** - URLs always match actual file locations
4. **User Experience** - Transparent, no user action required
5. **Reliability** - Graceful error handling, operations don't fail

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Batch Operations** - Delete multiple products at once
2. **Storage Metrics** - Track storage usage per seller
3. **Audit Logs** - Log all storage operations
4. **Rollback Support** - Restore deleted files within 30 days
5. **Background Jobs** - Move storage operations to queue for better performance

### Archive Instead of Delete

Currently, products can be archived (status: "archived"). Consider:

- Keep storage when archiving
- Only delete storage on permanent deletion
- Add "Restore" feature for archived products

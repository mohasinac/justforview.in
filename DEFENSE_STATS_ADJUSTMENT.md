# Defense Stats Adjustment - Complete

## Overview

Adjusted the defense stat formulas to provide more balanced scaling at maximum points (150).

## Changes to Defense Stats at 150 Points

### Previous Values (at 150 defense points)

- ❌ Damage Taken: 0% (completely immune)
- ❌ Knockback: 5 units (50% reduction)
- ❌ Invulnerability: 40% chance

### New Values (at 150 defense points)

- ✅ Damage Taken: 50% (0.5x - takes half damage)
- ✅ Knockback: 7.5 units (25% reduction)
- ✅ Invulnerability: 20% chance (1 in 5 hits)

## New Defense Formulas

### Damage Taken

- **Formula:** `base * (1 - points * 0.00333)`
- **Base:** 1.0x (100% damage taken)
- **At 150 points:** 0.5x (50% damage taken)
- **Per point:** -0.333% damage taken

### Knockback Distance

- **Formula:** `base * (1 - points * 0.00167)`
- **Base:** 10 units
- **At 150 points:** 7.5 units (25% reduction)
- **Per point:** -0.0167 units

### Invulnerability Chance

- **Formula:** `base * (1 + points * 0.00667)`
- **Base:** 10% (1 in 10 hits)
- **At 150 points:** 20% (1 in 5 hits)
- **Per point:** +0.0667% chance

## Example Stat Progression

### 0 Defense Points (Base)

- Damage Taken: 100% (1.0x)
- Knockback: 10 units
- Invulnerability: 10% (1 in 10)

### 50 Defense Points

- Damage Taken: 83.3% (0.833x)
- Knockback: 9.17 units
- Invulnerability: 13.3%

### 100 Defense Points

- Damage Taken: 66.7% (0.667x)
- Knockback: 8.33 units
- Invulnerability: 16.7%

### 150 Defense Points (Maximum)

- Damage Taken: 50% (0.5x) ✅
- Knockback: 7.5 units ✅
- Invulnerability: 20% (1 in 5) ✅

## Balanced Distribution (120/120/120)

With defense at 120 points:

- Damage Taken: 60% (takes 40% less damage)
- Knockback: 8 units
- Invulnerability: 18% chance

## Reasoning for Changes

### 1. Damage Taken Cap

**Old:** 0% at 150 points (complete immunity - too overpowered)
**New:** 50% at 150 points (still very tanky, but not immune)

- More balanced gameplay
- Still significant 50% damage reduction
- Rewards high defense investment without breaking the game

### 2. Knockback Reduction

**Old:** 5 units at 150 points (50% reduction)
**New:** 7.5 units at 150 points (25% reduction)

- More modest reduction to maintain positioning dynamics
- Prevents complete knockback immunity
- Still noticeable improvement at high defense

### 3. Invulnerability Chance

**Old:** 40% at 150 points (2 in 5 hits)
**New:** 20% at 150 points (1 in 5 hits)

- More reasonable proc rate
- Still significant defensive bonus
- Doesn't make Beyblade feel "untouchable"

## Files Updated

1. ✅ `src/types/beybladeStats.ts` - Updated defense calculation formulas
2. ✅ `src/components/admin/MultiStepBeybladeEditor.tsx` - Updated UI descriptions
3. ✅ `BASE_STATS_UPDATE.md` - Updated documentation with new values

## Testing Recommendations

- [ ] Test a 0/360/0 (pure defense) Beyblade - should take 50% damage at max
- [ ] Test a 150/0/210 Beyblade - verify knockback is 7.5 units
- [ ] Observe invulnerability proc rate in battles - should be ~1 in 5 hits
- [ ] Compare battle outcomes before/after change
- [ ] Verify damage reduction calculations are working correctly

## Impact

**Positive:**

- More balanced high-defense builds
- No more "unkillable" Beyblades
- Better gameplay variety
- Encourages mixed stat distributions

**Minimal:**

- Existing Beyblades automatically use new formulas
- No database migration required
- All changes are calculation-only

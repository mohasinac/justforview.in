## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Power Management

1. **Save for critical moments**: Don't waste power on random attacks
2. **Combine with loops**: Build power faster by staying in loops
3. **Time your strikes**: Wait for opponent to be vulnerable

### When to Use Cinematic Moves

✅ **Good Times**:

- Opponent spin < 600
- Opponent trapped or cornered
- You need to close out the match
- Opponent just used their special moves (cooldown)

❌ **Bad Times**:

- Your spin is very low (< 300)
- Opponent has positional advantage
- Early game (save power for later)
- Opponent is about to ring out naturally

### Move Selection

The system randomly chooses between Barrage and Time Skip (50/50 chance).

**Preferred Scenarios**:

- **Hope for Barrage when**: Opponent has low spin, guaranteed damage is best
- **Hope for Time Skip when**: Opponent has good position, need repositioning

## 🎨 Visual Cues

### Banner Appearance

- Dark overlay appears
- Gradient banner (Purple → Orange → Red)
- Golden text with glow effect
- Shows move name and player name
- Lasts 1 second

### During Execution

- **Barrage**: Attacker orbits around opponent
- **Time Skip**: Opponent frozen, attacker zooms in outer ring

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Move Won't Activate

**Check**:

1. ✅ Power is at 25 (full bar)?
2. ✅ Opponent is alive and in bounds?
3. ✅ 10 second cooldown has passed?

### Banner Doesn't Show

**Solution**: Banner auto-hides after 1 second - this is normal!

### Lost Control During Move

**Solution**: This is intentional! Both players lose control during cinematic moves. Wait for completion.

### Move Interrupted

**Possible Causes**:

- Opponent died during execution (move completes early)
- Opponent went out of bounds (move completes early)
- This is rare but handled gracefully

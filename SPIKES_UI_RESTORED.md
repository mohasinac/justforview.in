# Contact Points (Spikes) UI Restoration - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Restored the full spike editing UI that was lost during the WhatsApp-style image editor refactoring. The comprehensive damage points budget system is now back in Step 2 of the Multi-Step Beyblade Editor.

## What Was Restored

### 1. **Add Point Button & Click-to-Place Mode**

- ✅ "+ Add Point" button to toggle placement mode
- ✅ Click on canvas to place spikes at exact angles
- ✅ Up to 10 contact points maximum
- ✅ Crosshair cursor when in placement mode

### 2. **100 Damage Points Budget System**

- ✅ Visual progress bar showing points used (0-100)
- ✅ Real-time calculation of total damage points
- ✅ Warning when over budget (red alert)
- ✅ Suggestion when under budget (yellow tip)
- ✅ "⚖️ Auto Balance" button to distribute points evenly

### 3. **Individual Spike Editor**

- ✅ Click any spike card to expand its editor
- ✅ **Angle Slider** (0-360°) - Position around the beyblade
- ✅ **Damage Multiplier Slider** (1.0x-2.0x) - Bonus damage on hit
  - Shows both multiplier and point cost
  - 1.0x = 0 points, 2.0x = 100 points
- ✅ **Width Slider** (10-90°) - Angular width of spike hitbox
- ✅ Delete button (✕) to remove spike
- ✅ Color-coded feedback (purple for angle, orange for damage)

### 4. **Visual Feedback**

- ✅ Numbered badges (1, 2, 3...) for each spike
- ✅ Display angle, width, and damage on each card
- ✅ Show bonus points used per spike
- ✅ Highlight selected spike with purple border
- ✅ Scroll container for many spikes (max-h-96)

### 5. **Info & Help**

- ✅ Damage system explanation box
- ✅ Examples (1 spike = 2.0x, 2 spikes = 1.5x each)
- ✅ Empty state message with instructions
- ✅ Click instruction when in placement mode

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **MultiStepBeybladeEditor.tsx**

   - Added state: `isPlacingPoint`, `selectedPointIndex`
   - Added helper functions:
     - `getTotalDamagePoints()` - Calculate total points used
     - `getRemainingDamagePoints()` - Calculate points left
     - `autoBalanceDamage()` - Distribute points evenly
     - `updateSelectedPoint()` - Update angle/damage/width
     - `addContactPoint()` - Add new spike at clicked angle
     - `removeContactPoint()` - Delete spike
   - Replaced minimal spike UI with full budget system UI
   - Connected click handler to BeybladePreview

2. **BeybladePreview.tsx**
   - Added props: `onCanvasClick`, `clickMode`
   - Added `handleCanvasClick()` - Convert mouse position to angle
   - Added crosshair cursor when in placement mode
   - Added instruction text below canvas

## How It Works

### Budget System Math

```typescript
// Each spike has damageMultiplier from 1.0 to 2.0
// Points used = (damageMultiplier - 1.0) * 100
// Example:
//   1.0x = 0 points
//   1.5x = 50 points
//   2.0x = 100 points

// Total must be ≤ 100 points
// 1 spike: max 2.0x (100 points)
// 2 spikes: max 1.5x each (50 points × 2 = 100)
// 4 spikes: max 1.25x each (25 points × 4 = 100)
```

### Spike Placement Flow

1. User clicks "+ Add Point" button
2. `isPlacingPoint` becomes `true`
3. Canvas shows crosshair cursor
4. User clicks on preview canvas
5. Click position converts to angle (0-360°)
6. New spike added at that angle with default values:
   - `damageMultiplier: 1.0` (0 points)
   - `width: 45°`
7. `isPlacingPoint` resets to `false`
8. User can then adjust angle, damage, and width via sliders

### Auto Balance Feature

```typescript
// Distributes 100 points evenly across all spikes
const equalDamage = 1.0 + 100 / spikeCount / 100;

// Examples:
// 1 spike: 1.0 + 100/100 = 2.0x
// 2 spikes: 1.0 + 50/100 = 1.5x each
// 4 spikes: 1.0 + 25/100 = 1.25x each
```

## UI Colors & Design

- **Purple** - Main spike theme color
  - Purple-50 background
  - Purple-200 border
  - Purple-600 buttons and badges
- **Orange/Red** - Damage budget theme
  - Orange-100 to Red-100 gradient background

  - Orange-600 "Auto Balance" button
  - Orange progress bar (green → orange gradient)
- **Blue** - Info boxes
  - Blue-100 background
  - Blue-300 border
  - Blue-900 text

## What's Different from Original

### Improvements

1. ✅ Cleaner, more organized layout
2. ✅ Better color coordination
3. ✅ Integrated into multi-step wizard (Step 2)
4. ✅ Live preview always visible on the right
5. ✅ Click-to-place works directly on preview canvas

### Same Features Preserved

1. ✅ 100 damage points budget system
2. ✅ Up to 10 spikes maximum
3. ✅ Auto-balance functionality
4. ✅ All three spike properties (angle, damage, width)
5. ✅ Visual budget progress bar
6. ✅ Warning/tip messages for budget

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click "+ Add Point" button
- [ ] Click on canvas to place spike
- [ ] Verify spike appears in list below
- [ ] Click spike card to expand editor
- [ ] Adjust angle slider (0-360°)
- [ ] Adjust damage multiplier (1.0x-2.0x)
- [ ] Verify points calculation updates
- [ ] Adjust width slider (10-90°)
- [ ] Add multiple spikes
- [ ] Verify budget total updates (should stay ≤ 100)
- [ ] Try to go over budget (should show red warning)
- [ ] Click "Auto Balance" button
- [ ] Verify all spikes get equal damage
- [ ] Delete a spike with ✕ button
- [ ] Verify spike removed and budget updates
- [ ] Add maximum 10 spikes
- [ ] Verify "+ Add Point" button disables

## Game Integration

The spike data saved to the database is used during gameplay:

```typescript
interface PointOfContact {
  angle: number; // 0-360° position around beyblade
  damageMultiplier: number; // 1.0-2.0x damage bonus
  width: number; // 10-90° hitbox arc width
}

// During collision detection:
// 1. Calculate collision angle between beyblades
// 2. Check if angle matches any spike's angle ± width/2
// 3. If hit: apply damageMultiplier
// 4. If no hit: apply base 1.0x damage
```

## User Benefits

1. **Visual Spike Placement** - Click exactly where you want spikes
2. **Budget Management** - Can't accidentally create overpowered beyblades
3. **Flexible Strategy** - Choose between:
   - Few strong spikes (1-2 spikes at 1.5x-2.0x)
   - Many weak spikes (4-10 spikes at 1.0x-1.25x)
   - Hybrid approach (mix of strong and weak)
4. **Auto-Balance** - Quick equal distribution for testing
5. **Live Preview** - See spikes rendered on beyblade immediately

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All spike editing functionality has been restored. The user now has full control over contact points with the comprehensive damage budget system.

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Issue**: Missing spikes count input and damage input
**Resolution**: Restored full 100-damage-point budget system with click-to-place, individual spike editors, and auto-balance feature

# Role-Based User Registration Implementation

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

The application now supports role-based user registration where users can choose their account type during signup:

- 🛒 **Customer** - Browse and purchase products
- 🏪 **Seller** - Sell products and manage inventory
- ⚡ **Administrator** - Full platform access

## 🔧 **What Was Updated**

### 1. **Registration Form** (`/src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`)

- Added role selection dropdown with descriptions
- Dynamic role badge display
- Role-specific permission information
- Visual feedback for selected role

### 2. **Validation Schema** (`/src/lib/validations/schemas.ts`)

```typescript
export const registerSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z.string().min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters"),
  name: z.string().min(2, "Name must be at least 2 characters"),
  phone: z.string().optional(),
  role: z.enum(["admin", "seller", "user"]).default("user"), // ✨ NEW
});
```

### 3. **Auth Service** (`/src/lib/api/services/auth.service.ts`)

- Updated `register()` method to accept role parameter
- Role is now stored in both Firebase and JWT token
- Fallback mock user creation supports all roles

### 4. **JWT Types** (`/src/lib/auth/jwt.ts`)

```typescript
export interface JWTPayload {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "seller" | "user"; // ✨ Updated to include seller
  iat?: number;
  exp?: number;
}
```

### 5. **Firebase Service** (`/src/lib/firebase/services.ts`)

- Updated User interface to support seller role
- Database operations now handle all three roles

### 6. **Registration API** (`/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)

- API now processes role field from registration form
- Validates role using updated schema

## 🎨 **User Experience Features**

### **Role Selection UI**

```tsx
<select value={formData.role} onChange={handleChange}>
  <option value="user">🛒 Customer - Browse and purchase products</option>
  <option value="seller">🏪 Seller - Sell products and manage inventory</option>
  <option value="admin">⚡ Administrator - Full platform access</option>
</select>
```

### **Dynamic Permission Display**

The form shows different permissions based on selected role:

**Customer Role:**

- ✅ Browse and purchase products
- ✅ Manage account and orders
- ✅ Leave reviews and ratings
- ✅ Participate in auctions

**Seller Role:**

- ✅ All customer features
- ✅ Access to seller dashboard
- ✅ Add and manage products
- ✅ Process orders and inventory
- ✅ View sales analytics

**Administrator Role:**

- ✅ All customer and seller features
- ✅ Access to admin dashboard
- ✅ Manage all users and orders
- ✅ Platform-wide analytics
- ✅ System configuration

### **Visual Role Badge**

Selected role is displayed with color-coded badge:

- 🔴 **Admin** - Red badge (highest privilege)
- 🔵 **Seller** - Blue badge (business account)
- ⚪ **User** - Gray badge (standard account)

## 🚀 **How Role-Based Access Works**

### **Hierarchical Permissions**

```
Admin (Level 3)
  ↳ Can access: Admin Dashboard + Seller Dashboard + User Features

Seller (Level 2)
  ↳ Can access: Seller Dashboard + User Features

User (Level 1)
  ↳ Can access: User Features only
```

### **After Registration**

1. User selects role during registration
2. Role is validated by Zod schema
3. Role is stored in Firebase user document
4. JWT token includes role information
5. `RoleGuard` components check token for route access
6. Navigation shows appropriate dashboard buttons:
   - Admin users: See BOTH Admin + Seller buttons
   - Seller users: See ONLY Seller button
   - Regular users: See NO role-based buttons

## 📝 **Registration Flow Example**

1. **User visits** `/register`
2. **Fills form** with name, email, password
3. **Selects role** from dropdown (Customer/Seller/Admin)
4. **Sees permissions** for selected role
5. **Submits form** with role data
6. **Account created** with chosen role
7. **Redirected** to login page
8. **After login** - sees role-appropriate navigation

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**

### **Role Validation**

- All roles validated using Zod schema
- No client-side role elevation possible
- JWT tokens are server-side signed
- Role-based route protection with `RoleGuard`

### **Default Behavior**

- Default role is "user" if not specified
- Admin role requires explicit selection
- Seller role gives business features

- **Role Testing**: https://justforview-7ktva9lex-mohasin-ahamed-chinnapattans-projects.vercel.app/test-roles

## ✨ **Key Benefits**

1. **Clear Role Definition** - Users understand what they're signing up for
2. **Visual Feedback** - Role badges and permission lists
3. **Hierarchical Access** - Higher roles inherit lower role permissions
4. **Seamless Experience** - Role-appropriate dashboards after login
5. **Secure Implementation** - Server-side validation and JWT protection

## 🧪 **Testing the Feature**

1. Visit the registration page
2. Try different role selections
3. Observe permission changes
4. Create accounts with different roles
5. Login and verify dashboard access
6. Use `/test-roles` to validate role hierarchy

**The role-based registration system is now fully operational!** 🎉

Users can now choose their account type during registration, and the system will automatically provide them with the appropriate permissions and dashboard access based on their selected role.

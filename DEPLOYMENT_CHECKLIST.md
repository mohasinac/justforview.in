## Documentation

- [ ] Updated Vercel app URL

### Save Credentials

- [ ] Documented Render service name
- [ ] Documented Vercel project name
- [ ] Saved environment variables securely
- [ ] Updated team documentation (if applicable)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Socket Connection Fails:

- [ ] Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` in Vercel env vars
- [ ] Verify Render service is running (not sleeping)
- [ ] Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Render includes Vercel URL
- [ ] Test health endpoint directly
- [ ] Review Render logs for errors
- [ ] Clear browser cache and retry

### If Build Fails:

- [ ] Review error logs in dashboard
- [ ] Verify `socket-server.js` exists
- [ ] Check `package.json` has correct dependencies
- [ ] Try rebuilding: "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Clear cache and deploy"

### If CORS Errors Persist:

- [ ] Verify exact URL format (no trailing slash)
- [ ] Check both `http` and `https` in ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes after saving env vars for propagation
- [ ] Force redeploy both services

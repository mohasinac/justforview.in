# Cinematic Special Moves Integration Complete

## âœ… Status: FULLY INTEGRATED

Cinematic special moves system has been successfully integrated into the game loop!

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

### Activation

- **Key Binding**: Press **`5`** to activate cinematic special moves
- **Power Requirement**: 25 power (full power bar)
- **Cooldown**: 10 seconds after use

### Available Moves

The system randomly chooses between two cinematic moves:

1. **Barrage of Attacks** (50% chance)

   - Attacker orbits around defender at 4x radius
   - Performs 3 attacks at 120Â° intervals
   - Each attack deals 150 base damage (reduced to 105 for defender)
   - Both attacker and defender lose control during execution
   - Duration: ~4 seconds

2. **Time Skip** (50% chance)
   - Freezes defender and repositions them closer to center
   - Attacker performs high-speed loop in outer ring
   - Defender loses control and takes 400 spin damage on completion
   - Attacker maintains control during loop
   - Duration: ~4 seconds

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Summary

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/app/game/hooks/useGameState.ts`

**Changes:**

- Added imports for cinematic move system:

  ```typescript
  import {
    activateBarrageOfAttacks,
    activateTimeSkip,
    updateCinematicMoves,
    getActiveCinematicMove,
    getAllDamageNumbers,
    shouldLoseControl,
    type CinematicMoveState,
    type DamageNumber,
  } from "../utils/cinematicSpecialMoves";
  ```

- Added `cinematicMove` flag to `specialActionsRef`:

  ```typescript
  cinematicMove: boolean;
  ```

- Added key binding for "5" key:

  ```typescript
  if (key === "5") {
    event.preventDefault();
    specialActionsRef.current.cinematicMove = true;
  }
  ```

- Added cinematic move activation logic (after ultimate attack):

  ```typescript
  if (specialActionsRef.current.cinematicMove) {
    const canActivate =
      !playerBey.attackCooldownEnd ||
      newState.gameTime >= playerBey.attackCooldownEnd;
    const hasPower = (playerBey.power || 0) >= 25;
    if (
      canActivate &&
      hasPower &&
      aiBey &&
      !aiBey.isDead &&
      !aiBey.isOutOfBounds
    ) {
      // Randomly choose move type
      // Activate and show banner
    }
  }
  ```

- Added cinematic moves update in game loop:
  ```typescript
  updateCinematicMoves(
    newState.beyblades,
    mockStatsMap,
    newState.stadium,
    Date.now(),
    deltaTime
  );
  ```

#### 2. `src/app/game/types/game.ts`

**Changes:**

- Extended `GameState` interface:
  ```typescript
  export interface GameState {
    // ...existing fields
    cinematicBanner?: {
      moveName: string;
      userName: string;
      show: boolean;
    };
  }
  ```

#### 3. `src/app/game/components/GameArena.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added cinematic banner display:
  ```typescript
  if (gameState.cinematicBanner?.show) {
    // Draw semi-transparent overlay
    // Draw gradient banner background
    // Draw move name and user name with glow effects
  }
  ```

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features

### Cinematic Banner

- **Overlay**: Semi-transparent dark overlay (rgba(0, 0, 20, 0.85))
- **Background**: Gradient banner (Purple â†’ Orange â†’ Red)
- **Border**: Golden border with orange glow effect
- **Text**:
  - Move name: 56px bold, golden (#FFD700)
  - User name: 32px bold, white
- **Display Duration**: 1 second

### In-Game Effects

- Attacker and defender positions are controlled by the cinematic system
- Orbital movement for Barrage of Attacks
- Freeze and repositioning for Time Skip
- Damage numbers appear during attacks (from existing system)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Power System Integration

- **Cost**: 25 power (full bar)
- **Consumption**: Power deducted immediately on activation
- **Cooldown**: Uses existing attack cooldown system (10 seconds)

### Collision Detection

- Control loss flags prevent normal player input
- Cinematic moves override normal collision physics
- Damage is applied through existing collision system

### Animation Loop

- Cinematic moves update every frame via `updateCinematicMoves()`
- Phase transitions: banner â†’ windup â†’ execution â†’ complete
- Automatic cleanup after completion

### Multiplayer Compatibility

- System works in both single-player and multiplayer modes
- Player control checks respect player number
- State synchronization through existing game state updates

## ðŸ“Š System Architecture

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Tips

### For Players

1. Build power by:
   - Normal gameplay: +5 per second
   - Loops/Dash: +10 per second
2. Save power for strategic moments:
   - When opponent is low on spin
   - When trapped in disadvantageous position
   - To turn the tide of battle
3. Choose timing wisely:
   - 10 second cooldown is significant
   - Both moves disable your control temporarily
   - Plan your positioning before activation

### For Developers

1. The system is modular and extensible
2. Add new moves by:
   - Creating activation function in `cinematicSpecialMoves.ts`
   - Adding update logic for new move type
   - Including move type in random selection
3. Adjust parameters in move activation:
   - Damage values
   - Duration
   - Control flags
   - Orbital radius/speed
